# this example shows that you can put multiple statement on a single
# line in ruby using a semi-colon.
print "Hello, World!\n"; print "Hi\n"
# this line, without a semi-colon, will not compile nor work
#print "Hello, World!\n" print "Hi\n"
# you can use semi-colons to end lines, but this is redundant...
print "A line with a semi-colon with no need\n";
